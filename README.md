# Problems in the Python C API

The purpose here is to identify the problems in the current C API, and to determine which of them can be fixed incrementally.
Please create an issue in the repo for each problem you identify, and that particular issue can be discussed there.

We should avoid, for now, discussing proposals for a redesign of the C API. We will first enumerate the problems we are trying to solve, and once we have agreed on them we will be ready to discuss solutions.  However, we do not need to wait for that before we start fixing problems that can be fixed incrementally.
