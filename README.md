# Problems in the Python C API

This workgroup was set up following the recent Language Summit discussions about the C API.

The purpose here is to identify the problems in the current C API, and to determine which of them can be fixed incrementally.
Please create an issue in the repo for each problem you identify, and that particular issue can be discussed there.

We should focus, for now, on enumerating the problems rather than discussing API redesign proposals. We will be able to discuss new API designs only when we have a comprehensive view of the problems we are trying to solve.

However, we do not need to wait for that before we start fixing problems that can be fixed incrementally in the current C API. Issues can be marked with the "fixable" label, and within those issues it is fine to discuss pointed solutions to the specific problem covered by this issue.
